Exercise 1:  Perfect file
Write a console application to read data from a file to check as if the file is perfect or not. The file should contain the data as the information below:
•	It should have one or many lines.
•	Each line is formed up by ONLY numbers and the numbers are separated by spaces. 
•	The file is considered as invalid if it contains the other characters, except numbers and spaces.
•	A file is called PERFECT if every line meets the following criteria:
o	The number of positive numbers and negative numbers on each line are the same 
o	The Total of the numbers in each line equals to Zero (0)
 
This is the example of a valid file
1 2 15 6
2 -2 4
3 5 -1 -7
The line #3 is the PERFECT line, however, the file is not perfect.

Your task is to print out the screen the result: is a file perfect or not. Please use TDD methodology in development and make sure unit tests and integration tests are well-done.
